import React from "react";

// function Hello1(){
//     return <h1>Hello User from Hello1</h1>
// }

// export default Hello1;
//If we want to change the name at the time of import we use above approach

//Another way to create function using const and arrow operator : it is called as Named exports
//This type of approach is used when we want the same name of the component 

export const HelloFun = () =>  <h1>Hello Priyanka</h1>
